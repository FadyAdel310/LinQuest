*Question 1*:
A civil war outbreak in **Onga Bonga Republic of Wakanda**, the legitimate government in the capital **Gogogo** was surrounded by rebels from all directions except the south gate of the city, so the government decided to withdraw and evacuate the city quickly to another city called **Yaba Yaba**, and they want to take all the important governmental files and papers with them but this process will take long time and there is no time for that. One engineer suggests to scan all the files and put them in a local repository on a computer, and send a back-up of this data to a repository established by allied forces of **Kingdom of Tears** on a safe server, so which command you suggest to be used to send the data to this safe repository??

1. git pull
2. git add .
3. git commit
4. git push

Congratulations! Mr. President of The **United Regions of Murica**, ***Francis Joseph Underwood***.
You are now have a full control on the government, and now your Executive of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) ***Mr. Elon Task*** is eliminating the **URM** federal agencies and haulting several transactions in the Secretary of Treasury, while doing this, they accidentally deleted or corrupted or missed (We don't know yet) some important files in the system, leading to errors in the payment system as it stops workingo f the Secretary of Treasury, and now it became a scandal as **URM** lost about 150bn UR Dollars in the NAKDAK Stock market due to the consequences of this crisis! Federal Security Agencies started investigations and fortunately, there was git repository in the payment system, and now the feds want to know the history of all the commits, rebases clones, etc. your mission as a President is to give *exactly 2 git commands* to help them in the investigations. Thank you my fellow Murican and God bless the United Regions of Murica!!
