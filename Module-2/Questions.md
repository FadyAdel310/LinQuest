 3. Move a File
Scenario:
You are organizing system reports and need to move a file named sys_report.txt from /home/user/Documents to /var/log/reports/.

Challenge:
Write the command to move sys_report.txt to /var/log/reports/.
```bash
    # Write the command here
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Scenario:
Organizing Project Files
You just started working as a Linux system administrator, and your manager assigns you a task to organize project files in a structured way.

Task 1: Create a New File
Your manager asks you to create a new text file named report.txt inside the /home/user/Documents/ directory.

Write the command to create the file.

```bash
    # Write the command here

```
Task 2: Move the File to Another Directory
After creating the file, your manager decides that all reports should be stored in /home/user/Reports/.

Write the command to move report.txt from Documents to Reports.
```bash
    # Write the command here

```

Task 3: Rename the File
Now, your manager wants the file name to be more descriptive. You need to rename report.txt to final_report.txt inside the /home/user/Reports/ directory.

 Write the command to rename the file.

 ```bash
    # Write the command here

```

Bonus Challenge 
After completing the tasks, list all files in the /home/user/Reports/ directory to confirm that the file has been renamed successfully.

Write the command to list the files in /home/user/Reports/.
 ```bash
    # Write the command here

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Scenario: Extracting and Reading a Compressed File
You're a junior Linux administrator, and your manager has just sent you a compressed log file named logs.tar.gz. Your task is to extract the file and review its contents. However, you donâ€™t remember the exact commands to use, so you decide to rely on the Linux help system to guide you.
 ```bash
    # Write the commands here
    





```
